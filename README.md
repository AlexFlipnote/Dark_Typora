# Dark_Typora
A nice and dark theme for Typora, inspired by [GitHub](http://github.com)'s markdown style.<br>
Get Typora from https://www.typora.io, it's a free markdown text editor (better than Notepad in my opinion).

## How to install
1. Download the project [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Dark_Typora/archive/master.zip) (ZIP file)
2. Open Typora
3. Go to `File -> Preferences... -> Appearance -> "Open Theme Folder"` and copy all content inside the theme folder to the ZIP you just downloaded and place inside the window that appeared when pressing `Open Theme Folder`.
4. Find the theme in the `Themes` menu like the image bellow

You're more than welcome to contribute to the project by forking it and adding/changing whatever you think would be a good addition. Keep in mind that the project uses SASS (.scss) and not pure CSS, so you will have to download such from [here](https://sass-lang.com).
